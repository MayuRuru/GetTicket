# Get your ticket

MVP for displaying the items of a restaurant ticket and its total price.

This project uses React to further escalate components and to continue watching a mock api that could easy relate to a server database.

You can acces the [db.json](https://github.com/MayuRuru/GetTicket/blob/main/src/assets/data/db.json) file and add new items and you will see the total price increases!
