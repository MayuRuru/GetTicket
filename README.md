# Get your ticket

MVP for displaying the items of a restaurant ticket and its total price.

This project uses React to further escalate components and to continue watching a mock api that could easy relate to a server database.

You can acces the [db.json] file (https://github.com/MayuRuru/GetTicket/blob/main/src/assets/data/db.json) and add new items and you will see the total price increases!

### Clone this repo and install the required dependencies:

**Axios** `npm i axios`
**Json-server** `npm install json-server`

### Now run the following on your terminal:

`npm run mock_api`

Runs the API and watch if it changes.
Open [http://localhost:8000/tickets] (http://localhost:8000/tickets) to view it in your browser.

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Next steps:

- Testing all components and API rendering
- Adding UX/UI functionalities such as CRUD functions to edit, add or delete items from the ticket
